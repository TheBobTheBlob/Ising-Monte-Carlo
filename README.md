This project simulates a 2-dimensional Ising spin model using a Monte Carlo method (Metropolis algorithm) in Python. The Ising model is a mathematical model of ferromagnetism in statistical mechanics, and this simulation helps visualize the change in the subtance's energy as it goes to equilibrium.

## Running the algorithm

The simulation's settings can be edited by changing the constants in `main.py` (lines 14-17). Afterwards, simply run `main.py`.

```shell
python main.py
```

## Setup

Install dependencies using pip.

```shell
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```
